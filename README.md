Static Comp Challenge 2

This static comp challenge is one of a series of three challenges in Module 1 of Turing. I was asked to recreate a static comp, with some creative license but with respecting the integrity of the original design. 

Tools used:
Sublime
HTML/CSS
CSS Grid
CSS Flexbox

Here is the original design:
